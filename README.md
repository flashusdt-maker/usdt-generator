# USDT Flashing - Coin Flashr

## What is USDT Flashing?
**USDT flashing** is the process of sending USDT from one wallet to another through a transaction that eventually becomes invalid. This is done by manipulating the transaction signature, gas fees, or programmatically altering token decimals.

## USDT Flashing Software - Coin Flashr
**Coin Flashr** is a cutting-edge USDT flashing software that allows users to perform BTC and USDT flashing transactions across multiple variants of Bitcoin (including **Bitcoin Fantom** and **Wrapped Bitcoin**) and USDT (**ERC20**, **BEP20**, and **TRC20**).

> **Disclaimer:** Coin Flashr is a proof-of-concept solution designed for experimental purposes only. Flash tokens have a limited usage range and cannot be swapped due to a lack of liquidity. You cannot sell them on cryptocurrency exchanges. However, they can be transferred between cold and hardware wallets. Flash tokens are identical to real tokens until you inspect the underlying code.
